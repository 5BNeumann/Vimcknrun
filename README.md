# Vimcknrun
A vim plugin to execute Chicknrun functions from vim.

# Usage
You can configure the very many keybinds of this plugin in your ~/.vimrc with these lines :
```vim
let g:cr3check='<Fx>'
let g:cr3update='<Fx>'
let g:cr3norminette='<Fx>'
let g:cr3rungdb='<Fx>'
let g:cr3compile='<Fx>'
let g:cr3run='<Fx>'
let g:cr3runmain='<Fx>'
let g:cr3fullworkflow='<Fx>'
```
All of them are optionnal.

The x represent a number for the Function key but you can in fact change the keycombo altogether (see `man vim`).

# Installation
Put `Vimcknrun.vim` in ~/.vim/plugin
